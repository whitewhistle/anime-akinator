No way! These characters would much rather be dating their favorite 2-D character from an anime, manga, visual novel or other form of media.\n","\n","Abnormally Tall : Abnormally Tall characters are substantially taller than other members of the cast, often towering over their cohorts. This unique attribute is often a source of ridicule from their peers.\n","\n","Actors : Actors and actresses are those who perform on stage, television, or in movies, both professionally and as amateurs.\n","\n","Adults : Adults are characters that are between the ages of 20 to 64.\n","\n","Afros : These characters sport an Afro, a large, rounded hairstyle achieved by combing hair outwards from the scalp with a pick.\n","\n","Agents of the Afterlife : These characters perform a job for their employers in the Afterlife, whether they're sent from Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, or somewhere else. Angels, Demons, and Shinigami are common examples.\n","\n","Airheads : Ever seen a character and wondered just how they could be THAT dumb? Airheads are individuals who are especially idiotic, dim-witted, or just plain clueless. They often have a lack of common sense, live in their own little worlds or have a childlike dependence on others.\n","\n","Alchemists : Alchemists pursue the knowledge and materials for creating such items as the legendary Philosopher's stone and elixir of immortality. They are particularly known for being able to transmute one element into another, as well creating the artificial beings known as the Homunculi.\n","\n","Aliens : Aliens hail from a different planet than where the series takes place. For example, if an anime takes place on Mars, a lone Earthling would be considered an alien, not the Martian.\n","\n","Amnesia : Characters with amnesia have partial or full memory loss. These characters suffer from amnesia due to an injury or trauma, an Illness, or a Supernatural occurrence.\n","\n","Analytical : These characters frequently analyze people, objects or situations for the sake of concocting a strategy, whether they're trying to solve a crime, determining how to win a military battle, or figuring out the best way to win a game.\n","\n","Androids : Androids are Robots that are made to look and sometimes act as humans, unlike Cyborgs, which are organic characters with robotic parts or upgrades.\n","\n","Androphobia : Androphobia is defined as an irrational fear of men. These characters have extreme reactions to the men in their lives, from panicking to having an intense allergic reaction to anything in between.\n","\n","Angels : These characters are winged, haloed angels from heaven.\n","\n","Animal Ears : These characters have Animal Ears as a natural extension of their body.\n","\n"]}],"source":["\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","import requests\n","\n","url = 'https://www.anime-planet.com/characters/tags'\n","\n","r = requests.get(url)\n","\n","soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'html.parser')\n","\n","for td in soup.find_all('td', class_=\"volsChRating\"):\n","    a = td.find('a')\n","    p = td.find('p')\n","    print(a.text,\":\", p.text)\n","    print()"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":48.698068,"end_time":"2023-03-15T19:19:26.459649","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-03-15T19:18:37.761581","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
